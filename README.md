This project relies on the Quote API provided by [type.fit](https://type.fit/api/quotes) to fetch inspirational quotes.

## Technical Details

VSQuote was developed using a range of technical skills and knowledge, including:

- **JavaScript:** The extension's core functionality is built using JavaScript.

- **Axios:** Axios is used to make HTTP requests to the Quote API to fetch quotes.

- **Async/Await:** Async and await are employed for handling asynchronous operations, such as API requests.

- **APIs:** The extension fetches quotes from the Quote API provided by [type.fit](https://type.fit/api/quotes) in JSON format.

- **VSCode API:** VSQuote leverages the VSCode API, including features like the `window` object for notifications and the `setInterval` function to fetch new quotes at specified intervals (every hour).

- **Random Quotes:** The extension randomly selects quotes from the API to provide users with diverse and inspiring messages.
